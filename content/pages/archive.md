This is your blog landing page. ðŸ›¬

The content in `./content/pages/archive.md` (this file, if youâ€™re reading it in a text editor) appears above the section of posts generated by `./_includes/layouts/archive.11ty.js`. In that layout, the contents of this Markdown file are represented by `${data.content}`.

You can use this file to provide some context for your blog. Or you can delete the content below the closing `---` and just show a list of posts.
